#LESSON 1
       
1. learnt how to create a repository on github.  
2. Learnt how to edit readme file on github and commit changes  
3. To use git, I have to install git on my computer. To do that,  
    I have to first check if git is already installed on my computer. 
    I do that by opening the command line and typing "git --version" in the command line.
    Git wasn't installed on my laptop, 
    so i went to git website and install the one compatible with windows.  
4. Next, I learnt how to clone the repository, 
    which can also serve as a folder, I created on github to my computer. I do that by 
    clicking the repository on github and clicking on the "code" drop down bar and copying the 
    ssh link. I got down to my terminal on VScode terminal and type "git clone" and paste the code after 
    and then click enter. The repository will automatically be downloaded to my computer.          
5. After cloning, there are files that do not appear(hidden). To see those files, 
    I have to type the command "ls -la" command 
    in the terminal. After entering that command, a .git folder appers apart from other visible files. 
    The .git folder stores all the files that saves my commits and code changes overtime.
